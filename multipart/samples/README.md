`multipart` Sample Projects
===========================

These are simple but fully fledged Cargo/Rust application projects to show how to use `multipart` with the various crates it integrates with.

These projects carry the same licenses as [`multipart` itself](https://github.com/cybergeek94/multipart#license), though this may be lightened to a copyright-free license in the near future.

More sample projects are underway and volunteers to create them are still needed. See [this issue](https://github.com/cybergeek94/multipart/issues/29) for more information.
