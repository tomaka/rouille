/// A builder for saving a file or files to the local filesystem.
///
/// ### `OpenOptions`
/// This builder holds an instance of `std::fs::OpenOptions` which is used
/// when creating the new file(s).
///
/// By default, the open options are set with `.write(true).create_new(true)`,
/// so if the file already exists then an error will be thrown. This is to avoid accidentally
/// overwriting files from other requests.
///
/// If you want to modify the options used to open the save file, you can use
/// `mod_open_opts()`.
///
/// ### File Size and Count Limits
/// You can set a size limit for individual files with `size_limit()`, which takes either `u64`
/// or `Option<u64>`.
///
/// You can also set the maximum number of files to process with `count_limit()`, which
/// takes either `u32` or `Option<u32>`. This only has an effect when using
/// `SaveBuilder<[&mut] Multipart>`.
///
/// ### Warning: Do **not** trust user input!
/// It is a serious security risk to create files or directories with paths based on user input.
/// A malicious user could craft a path which can be used to overwrite important files, such as
/// web templates, static assets, Javascript files, database files, configuration files, etc.,
/// if they are writable by the server process.
///
/// This can be mitigated somewhat by setting filesystem permissions as
/// conservatively as possible and running the server under its own user with restricted
/// permissions, but you should still not use user input directly as filesystem paths.
/// If it is truly necessary, you should sanitize user input such that it cannot cause a path to be
/// misinterpreted by the OS. Such functionality is outside the scope of this crate.
